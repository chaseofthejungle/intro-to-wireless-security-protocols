# Intro to Wireless Security Protocols Overview Guide

**Description/Overview:** Four commonly known wireless security protocols include WEP and three versions of WPA: WPA, WPA2, and WPA3. Of these four protocols, WEP and WPA are widely considered obsolete (although WPA introduced security improvements, through the implementation of dynamic encryption keys and TKIP), WPA2 is still in popular use today (especially when WPA3 is not readily plausible), and WPA3 offers the strongest encryption, authentication, and other protections.

| Characteristic | Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) | Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) | WPA2 | WPA3 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Quality | Poor (obsolete). Heavily vulnerable. | Poor (obsolete). Heavily vulnerable, though not as much as WEP. | Good, but WPA3 is more secure. | Most secure (strongest encryption and authentication). |
| Encryption Standard | RC4 (with Static Keys) | TKIP (with Dynamic Keys) | AES (with CCMP) | AES (with GCMP) |
